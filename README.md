Have you ever played that game in wikipedia where you try to click as few links as possible to get to a specific topic? Like Spartacus to the fairly odd parents?

That is what this program is inspired by. Not the game itself, but the attempt to grab every link in relation to a root topic, gets all the wiki links in that page, and then goes to the pages in that list and grabs all the links in those areas as well. And then does that again until i say to stop or until every single link leads to something already in the structure and therefore is a dead end.

Ever wondered how far unrelated you can get to a certain topic? Ever wondered what the resulting diagram looks like when you connect all the links to each other? Me too. Lets see what we can find out.
